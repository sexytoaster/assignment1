I created a ui for USS Discovery from the new Star Trek Discovery

I included many things I had seen on the panels in the show

instructions:
1.you can hover over the ship to see the systems
2.clicking black alert bring you into black alert
3. wait for the spore drive to charge. you can see how long it
will be by hovering over the engine area of the ship
4. when the button says engage, you can click it to activate the drive
5. to deactivate black alert, click the button again.

the things im most proud of are :
1. the rotating proceduraly generated galaxy map that has random chances of showing "Klingon activity"
at random stars in the galaxy. It highlights them in red. it also highlights in white planets of 
interest. I made it rotate in 2d space to give the apprearence of 3d rotation too.

2. the black alert. When black alert is pressed, like in the show we see some mycelium spores around
the panel. It makes the ship feel alive and i thought it would be cool to add. it also darkens the ui
like in the show. Once black alert is active the auxiliary and shields systems start losing power
as it is diverted to the engines and spore drive, like the show.

3.the spore drive. When black alert is active, the button fades in and out of different reds like its
pulsing. it will say offline when not in black alert, charging when waiting for the spore drive to hit 
100% and engage once its ready. After you hit the button, the mycelium at the edges of the screen
get faster and start actually coming over the panel. the panel also fades to light blue to give
the spore drive effect. The mycelium is also proceduraly generated in a range outside of the screen
bounds. This took some thinking to figure out, as id only ever generated particles on screen and not 
exclusively in the area around it.

4. the ship schematic. This is something thats on nearly every helm in every star trek era. I thought
it would be great to add aesthetically, but i also found a use for it funtionally. I made it so when 
you hover over the different parts of the ship, it will display a tooltip telling you the shield level
and the engines and the different systems. This i thought was really cool and turned a drawing into
a key component of the ship.

I think i did a good job staying true to the aesthetic of the series. Theres a few more features I
would have loved to add but that might have to wait until the future.

Hope you like it

Qapla'!
